## Contributing

This is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new sections, fixes to
existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all
welcome.

That said,
since the material is in a very early stage of development, 
it would be most productive to [get in touch with the main author][contact]
to discuss what would be useful,
before getting started.

### Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved agrees to abide by
our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving
existing ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug
reports][repo-issues] about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and newcomers
are particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been using these
lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so
fresh eyes are always welcome.

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

NB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch.

Each lesson has a team of maintainers who review issues and pull requests or
encourage others to do so. The maintainers are community volunteers, and have
final say over what gets merged into the lesson.
